Lauren Tompkins is an assistant professor of Physics.  After receiving her BA, MA and PhD in physics from UC Berkeley and completing a postdoc at the University of Chicago, she joined Stanford in the fall of 2014.  She is passionate about the physics of subatomic particles, equity and inclusion in physics and astronomy, communicating science to the public, and any activity that gets her outdoors! <br> <br>

Rex completed his B.S.E. degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Physics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  While there, he worked with microparticle thrusters, developed code for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), calibrated the magnetometers on the Radio Aurora eXplorer (RAX) satellite, and led the Endcap Extension (EE) Chamber commissioning project at CERN as part of the University of Michigan CERN REU. He was also a rank leader and member of the Michigan Marching Band (MMB) and president of the University of Michigan Amateur Radio Club (UMARC)

He chose to pursue physics in his graduate career, and entered the Physics Ph.D. program at Columbia University where he specialized in particle physics. He was also selected to teach the particle physics course in the Science Honors Program (SHP), which is a program that allows high-performing high school students to study advanced topics in the sciences. Additionally, he worked under Professor Michael Tuts on the development of a 12-bit, 40 Msps Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to be used in future ATLAS experiment upgrades. He left Columbia after completing his M.A. in physics to explore opportunities on the west coast, and joined the group here at Stanford in October of 2014.  His interests include cars, motorcycles, airplanes, golf, tennis, ping pong, and amateur radio. <br> <br>

Nikolina.Ilic@cern.ch <br> 

Nikolina Ilic obtained her bachelor's degree in Honors Mathematical Physics from the University of Waterloo. During this time she became involved in several projects, including quantum cryptography, CKM matrix measurements using ion traps and ATLAS detector calibration. She chose to pursue acareer in the latter, obtaining a PhD in High Energy Physics from the University of Toronto. During her PhD she was involved in the search for the Higgs Boson in the WW channel, a measurement of Vector Boson Scattering, as well as operation of the ATLAS's electromagnetic calorimeter and performance studies of jets and missing transverse energy. Nikolina joined the Stanford group in February 2015. In her spare time she enjoys wakeboarding, snowboarding, squash and salsa dancing. <br> <br>

Victor H. Ruelas-Rivera was awarded a bachelor's degree in Physics and Astronomy from Whitman College, a small liberal arts college in Washington state. At Whitman College he did research on the chemical composition of space dust particles by fitting data of stellar spectra to synthetic spectral energy distributions focusing mainly in the ultraviolet range. He also did work in computational physics and physics simulation where he simulated various physical systems such as capacitor plates, gaseous systems and mechanical systems. Victor then decided to pursue a High Energy Physics MS degree at the California State University, Fresno. Victor joined the Stanford group in 2014 as a visiting summer student and has done work such as efficiency studies of the Fast TracKer, an upgrade to the ATLAS trigger system, planned to operate in run 2 of the LHC. Also, he is currently working on creating a database for the Fast TracKer Data Formatter's configurations and integrate the database in the ATLAS main control system to load and unload configurations on demand. Victor has interests in large scale programming, quantum computing research and its applications, app development, data mining, and entrepreneurship. He also has other interests such as extraterrestrial life forms, climate change, world politics and sustainable and ecological business plan development.

Mingyu Kang graduated Korean Minjok Leadership Academy (KMLA) in 2014. He joined Stanford University Class of 2018 as a B.A. candidate in physics. He first encountered physics by a science cartoon book about atomic and subatomic physics. No wonder why he is working in this wonderful group! His experience in International Young Physicists' Tournament (IYPT) also led him to physics research projects. Moreover, he is also deeply interested in producing music, and is planning to minor in Music, Science, and Technology. <br> <br>
