This is the last week of my research. Here is the list of things I have done in this lab.

* I built this website! 

* I tested the function of the first three Fast TracKer DF boards. A test consists of four procedures: 1. Visual Inspection 2. LED Blink Test 3. RTM Test 4. Backplane Test. Particularly the RTM (Rear Transition Module) test and the backplane test is done by IBERT (Integrated Bit Error Ratio Test) and Eye Scan test. All of the boards fully passed the tests, and two of them were sent to CERN.

* I am working for opening access to a temperature sensor in the IPMC card. This is very crucial to the Fast TracKer because if a board gets overheated it can blow up the whole system. Currently, ICARE, the program we should use, does not support our sensor, so we are updating the information about the sensor to the program. 

* I am working on backplane characterization. Although the backplane in our lab functions perfectly in the rate of 8Gbps, it seems unstable in 10Gbps, the rate we should achieve. I am doing the IBERT and Eye Scan test for each link in the backplane in order to figure out which links should be fixed.
